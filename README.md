# Musical analysis

In this work, I used some datasets provided by my teachers at my master's degree and try to analyze them using Python's packaging tools, in order to create a complete Python project structure.

## Tasks

This work was made in the context of one of my courses and therefore the following goals were to be reached in order to pass. I was asked to:

+ De-normalize the original files, getting a coherent structure and correcting some of the mistakes the original data contains.
+ Use alternative ways of reading .csv files aiming to be capable of handling data of more than 1Gb.
+ Create some filtering and basic counters answering to a series of questions (the info given in the #3 section of the main file answers these questions).
+ Analyze the audio features, getting some statistical markers of the data and some graphs.
+ Get the (normalized) histogram of a feature of a certain artist.
+ Get a visual comparison with 2 types of distance between two artists' features.

## Method

For this work, I implemented a complete project structure, where the main.py script is in charge of calling the auxiliar functions. The helpers.py script does all the auxiliar work, and the plotters.py file executes the graphing functions.
